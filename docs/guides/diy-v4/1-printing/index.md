# 3D Printing Parts

The first step in building your LumenPnP is 3D printing all the parts!

!!! danger "Reprint Everything"
    If you're upgrading an existing machine to v4, it might be tempting to only reprint a subset of the parts. While some of the parts *might* be compatible or at least similar, we **recommend reprinting everything**, because every new release of the machine might have changed something. It's just a bit over a kilogram of plastic for a LumenPnP, so it's not much more material to ensure parity with the version you're building to.

    If you're upgrading from a v3.1 or v3.2, you can *technically* get away with not reprinting the front and back legs. Although there are some quality of life improvements in these files, it can save you from having to fully disassemble your Y gantries (only the `y-gantry` print itself *needs* to be reprinted for v4). 

## Getting the files

You've picked a version number, so you can go to that release and download all the STLs attached to the release in a zip file! This has all the printable CAD in the machine for your version.

## Materials and Colors

Details about what to print can all be found in the Bill of Materials for your version. This is also downloadable from your version's release. The BoM is a standalone webpage (just double click the HTML file to open it in a browser) that tells you everything you need to build a machine, including what color or material to 3D print all the files in, along with a render of the part. Use this for reference on what filament to use when printing.

In general, most parts are intended to be printed in PLA. Folks have printed a Lumen in ABS, PETG, SLA resin, and even SLS nylon. All have their tradeoffs, but we've found we get the best performance from PLA. Note that the `dynamic-board-mount` is the only part in the BoM that *requires* PETG for its flexibility.

## Slicer Settings

This varies wildly across printer, material, environment, etc. but good rules of thumb are:

- 4 shells
- At least 20% infill, triangular or hexagonal
- Support mostly not needed, but can be helpful
- 0.2 mm layer height
