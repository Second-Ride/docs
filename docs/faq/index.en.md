# FAQ
## Details about the Conversion Kit
### How far can I really go with the battery?
Up to 70 km! There are two different battery sizes to choose from. The base version has 1.8 kWh, which corresponds to a range of 50 km. The larger version offers 2.5 kWh for up to 70 km.
Cells from LG and Samsung with the highest quality standards are used.

### Is there a second battery?
Not yet. There have been many ideas about placing a second battery: in the tank or in the side bag, for example. While it is a firm goal to enable further range in the future, we cannot say much about the "how" at this time.

### How can I convert my Simson?
You can do it yourself or have it done at your trusted workshop. You will receive a detailed printed manual as well as video tutorials to assist you with the conversion. Carlo, an experienced mechanic, completes the conversion in 30 minutes, Sebastian, with less experience, takes about 3 hours. If you are unsure, any workshop can perform the conversion with a manageable amount of time. Are you running a workshop and interested in collaborating with us or do you know someone who is?

### How fast does the Simson drive with the electric conversion?
The conversion kit, assuming an existing approval from the former GDR, is approved for 60 km/h. In the future, we will offer additional motor variants.

### Regeneration: Does the motor recover energy when braking?
Yes! As soon as you stop accelerating, the motor converts your kinetic energy back into electricity and charges the battery. This not only lets you travel further overall but also extends the lifespan of your brakes.

### What is the Second Ride Community?
The Second Ride Community is a forum hosted on the Discord platform. Several hundred Second Ride riders already exchange ideas and experiences there. We have already incorporated much feedback from the forum into our development. Additionally, community members help each other with issues related to approval and conversion. We would be happy to welcome you soon! Once you purchase a conversion kit, you will find the link to the forum in the shop login area.

### How does the approval process work?
The Second Ride conversion kit includes a sample expert report. After a successful conversion, you go to your local technical service or inspection station (TÜV, Dekra, etc.), which will check your vehicle for general roadworthiness (e.g., is the conversion kit professionally installed, what is the general condition of the vehicle, etc.). The conversion kit itself is not technically tested—the tests required for approval are performed by us and officially confirmed in the expert report.  
After approval, a formal process follows: you must go to the local registration office to update the operating permit.
