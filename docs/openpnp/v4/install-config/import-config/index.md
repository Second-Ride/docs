# Importing V4 Configuration Files

![](../../calibration/images/lumenpnp-v4-docs-logo-small.png)

**To properly use OpenPnP with the LumenPnP V4**, you need to configure the software with your machine's specifications, such as size, camera setup, and other essential settings. To simplify this, we provide a set of pre-configured files. Follow the steps below to import them correctly.

⚠️ If you are setting up a LumenPnP V3, you cannot use this page. Follow [this link](../../../../misc/import-config/index.md) to the correct V3 config files. ⚠️
