# First Job - Introduction

## What you'll learn

This guide walks you through setting up and running your first PCB assembly job using the [Getting Started Kit](https://opulo.io/products/getting-started-kit), included with the LumenPnP.

Before starting, ensure you've completed the [Calibration](../calibration/index.md) guide to get your LumenPnP up and running. Proper calibration is needed for accurate part placement.

This guide isn’t just for first-time setup. You’ll revisit these steps whenever you start a new board until you have the process memorized. The process becomes much faster with experience, so take your time on your first run to build a solid understanding.

## Tutorial Video
