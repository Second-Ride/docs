# ðŸ“š Second Ride Documentation

Welcome to the Second Ride Documentation!  
Here you will find all information about our conversion kits and products â€“ from conversion guides and user manuals to technical details for developers or maintenance purposes.

At the bottom right of the page, you will also find a **chatbot** that knows the entire documentation. It will help you quickly and, if you wish, show you the relevant section in the docs for your question.

ðŸ“¦ **Less paper, more sustainability:**  
From now on, we no longer include printed manuals â€“ for the sake of the environment. If you still want to print something, the page is of course suitable for that.
