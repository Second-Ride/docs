## Switching On/Off

To switch on the vehicle, simply connect the seat bench with the cable and turn the ignition switch (turn key 90° clockwise). After a maximum of 5 seconds, the charge level indicator performs a function test (needle moves to the maximum stop and back), and the vehicle’s onboard system is supplied with 12V.  
If the original Simson ignition switch is in position “II” and there is no fault in the onboard system, the lights should turn on.  
When the ignition switch is on “II” and no fault exists, the lights turn on.  

After that, the vehicle is in **inactive driving mode** – indicated by a pulsating LED on the control button.

Now the vehicle is in **inactive driving mode**, as shown by the dimming LED on the control button. If you now press the button briefly once, it lights continuously and you are in **active driving mode**. When you twist the throttle, the vehicle accelerates.  
It is not possible to switch to active driving mode if the vehicle is rolling or the throttle is not at 0%. Only when motor RPM is back to 0 and the throttle is at 0% will throttle response work again.

**Caution**: It may feel unusual that there is no engine noise ;)

To end the ride, you can either switch off the ignition again (90° counterclockwise), which shuts down the whole vehicle, or press the button again, which puts the vehicle back into inactive driving mode.

After 10 minutes without throttle use, the vehicle automatically switches back to inactive driving mode to prevent unintentional acceleration.

## Control Button LED: Indicator Behavior
Below are all LED patterns of the control button:

| Light Pattern                          | Meaning                                           |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| LED dims in and out                    | Inactive mode (lights/horn on, no throttle)       |
| LED steady on                          | Active mode, no fault                             |
| LED continuous blinking                | Active mode with limitation                       |
| 3x short flashes after button press    | Battery empty – please recharge                   |

## Acceleration

Unlike driving with a combustion engine, there is no clutch, shifting, or kickstarter. Acceleration works like the original vehicle, by twisting the throttle. Note that the electric motor accelerates faster, so smaller throttle movements are required.

---

## Braking

Brake operation remains unchanged. However, note that when the brake contact is engaged, the vehicle will not accept throttle and will recuperate. When the brake contact is released and no throttle is applied, throttle response becomes possible again.  
This is a safety mechanism to ensure that in case of unintended acceleration, the motor can be safely disengaged.

---

## Recuperation

When you release the throttle, the electric motor begins braking. It converts kinetic energy into electrical energy and feeds it back into the battery – this is called recuperation. Recuperation extends your range and brake life. A true win-win!  
When the battery is fully charged, recuperation is disabled to prevent overcharging. The motor then simply idles when you release the throttle. Recuperation is also disabled if battery temperature is outside 0…+45°C. This may cause the motor to stutter because it tries to recharge the battery but the battery rejects the charge.

**Caution!** On wet or slippery roads, strong recuperation may cause the rear wheel to skid. You can control recuperation strength by adjusting the throttle slightly.

---

## Lights

The Simson ignition switch now only serves to select between position “II” (lights on, horn and blinkers functional) and parking lights at the fourth position clockwise.  
Always ensure the Simson ignition switch is in the third position clockwise before riding, otherwise blinkers, horn, and lights may not work.

The lights turn off automatically when the conversion kit ignition is turned to off.

If the charge level indicator reaches 0%, driving is no longer possible, but lights will still work. Use them only in emergencies, as frequent deep discharge reduces battery life. If voltage drops further, the battery management system shuts the battery off completely. For long battery life, avoid this as much as possible.

---

## Charge Level Indicators

The kit has two charge indicators: one on the dashboard and one under the seat bench. The dashboard indicator is always active when the ignition is on and the seat bench is connected. The seat bench indicator must be switched on via the button on its right side and turns off automatically after a few seconds.

For both indicators: values are most accurate after a few minutes of rest (no charging or discharging). The dashboard indicator can estimate charge even under load, while the seat bench indicator is designed only for rest readings. During charging, the seat bench indicator always shows slightly higher values because it uses battery voltage as reference.

---

## Charging the Battery

Remove the seat bench and connect the charger to the seat bench and a standard household socket (230VAC 50–60Hz). The LEDs on the charger show charging status:

| Charger Model:              | 0.4 kW                        | 1.0 kW                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| No battery connected        | 🟢 green LED steady           | 🟢…1s… ⚫…1s… green LED blinks every 2 sec |
| Battery charging            | 🔴 red LED steady             | 🔴 red LED steady                         |
| Battery full / not charging | 🟢 green LED steady           | 🟢 green LED steady                       |

The 1kW charger also displays other LED codes for error conditions.

Charging is only possible within 0–45°C. Outside this range, the BMS prevents charging. In this case, the charger may indicate “full” while the seat bench indicator shows otherwise. Allow the battery to acclimatize at room temperature for at least one hour, then try again.

For long life, store the battery at room temperature in winter and recharge every 3 months. Never store at 0% – this risks deep discharge and reduces battery life drastically.

Both chargers are for indoor use only, in non-tropical climates and below 2000m altitude. Protect the charger, plugs, and seat bench from moisture. Never connect wet plugs. Store the drive module plug under the cover when not in use.

Avoid charging immediately before or after a ride. Especially the 1kW charger warms the battery additionally. High-temperature use shortens lifespan and may reduce performance (*see Limp Mode & Emergency Shutdown*).

Only use the supplied or approved chargers. Using others may cause damage.

Never leave charging unattended. Disconnect charger after full charge.

## Handling the Seat Bench

The seat bench has a front handle for carrying. When placing upside down, ensure the connector is not damaged. On flat ground, the rubber pads protect it, but on uneven ground it may be at risk.  
It can also be placed on its backside with the “Second Ride” logo, but ensure it cannot fall over. Avoid placing it on the upholstered side and protect the cover from sharp objects.

The seat bench is splash-proof, not waterproof. Do not use it if submerged – contact us immediately.

To connect seat bench with the drive module or charger, simply push connectors together when properly aligned. To disconnect, press the black button on the side of the plug to unlock.

---

## Lithium-Ion Battery Handling

To maximize lifespan, follow these guidelines:

### Riding
Best use between 20%–80% charge. Avoid frequent 0% discharges.  
Recommended operating temperature: 15–35°C.  
Avoid regular use under 0°C or over 50°C.

### Charging
Prefer daily charging to 80%. Only charge to 100% when needed.  
Don’t leave battery at 100% for long.  
Let the battery adjust to room temperature (2–3h) after long rides in extreme temps before charging.

### Storage
For long-term storage, store at 30–50% at room temperature.  
Self-discharge is 1–3%/month. Check occasionally and recharge if too low.

### Motivation
Proper use can extend life from 500 cycles to over 1000. Equivalent to 45,000–63,000 km.  
Saves €1700–2400 in fuel compared to combustion.

## Maximizing Range

Highest range is achieved with:
1. Battery temp 20–30°C (30% less at 0°C)  
2. Flat terrain  
3. Low average speed  
4. Low weight  
5. High tire pressure  
6. Low 12V consumption (LEDs instead of bulbs)  
7. Smooth driving (avoid braking/accelerating, keep constant speed)  
8. Proper chain tension  

Our tested ranges: 50 km (1.9 kWh) and 70 km (2.5 kWh) in Berlin city traffic at 20°C, avg 30 km/h, driver 80 kg, correct tire pressure, bulbs, correct chain tension, sporty driving style.

## Limp Mode & Emergency Shutdown

### 2.5 kWh 72V and 50V packs:
At -10…+50°C or ≤10% charge, power is gradually reduced.  
At -20…+60°C, battery shuts down.  
Recuperation and charging only possible at 0…+45°C.

### 1.8 kWh 50V pack:
At -10…+60°C or ≤10% charge, power is gradually reduced.  
At -20…+75°C, battery shuts down.  
Recuperation and charging only possible at 0…+50°C.

Tips:
- In summer: park in shade  
- In winter: store at room temp, 20–50% charge  
- Don’t charge right before rides  
- Reduce load to maximize range

## Theft Protection

Turn key left and remove it to lock.  
Seat bench is locked with side lock. Flush cylinder = locked.

---

## Vehicle Handling

When lifting (loading, etc.), never lift by seat bench or drive module. Use luggage rack handle.

---

## Cleaning

Do not use pressure washer or harsh chemicals. Use damp cloth and mild soap.

---

## Maintenance & Repair

Compared to combustion, much less maintenance.  
- Oil ignition and seat locks once a year  
- Grease chain and speedometer drive  
- Replace worn chain per manual  
- Drive sprocket available on request  
- Electrical repairs only by experts – orange cables are high-voltage  
- Keep original packaging for safe transport if return needed  

Safety disconnect: Seat bench plug. Once unplugged, no HV remains within 1 second.

The throttle grip should snap back from the fully open position solely by spring force. If it does get stuck while riding, you can press the foot brake to cut motor power. You can also switch off the vehicle via the new ignition lock or switch to inactive driving mode using the button while riding. Second Ride GmbH assumes no liability for damage caused by a sticking or sluggish throttle cable.**|
