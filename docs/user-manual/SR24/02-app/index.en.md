# Before you start the conversion/app usage

The intended purpose of the above-mentioned accessory component is installation according to this assembly manual, as well as its use on public roads according to the user manual. Please understand that during the development of the conversion kit and accessories, we based everything on the original condition of the mentioned Simson models. In case of modifications with parts that do not correspond to the original, or changes to the original parts due to accident, wear, or intentional modifications, we cannot guarantee that the conversion kit and accessories will work properly and safely, or that they can be installed at all. If you are unsure about your vehicle, feel free to contact us.  

This document is provided by Second Ride GmbH and is intended as a supplement to the original manufacturer’s manual. Both documents are to be seen as one unit. They belong together, while explanations about the combustion engine can be disregarded.  

Please read this document carefully and completely before starting the conversion and before taking your first ride. Here you will find warnings and notes, information and advice, as well as emergency measures and other important notes about your vehicle. Failure to follow these instructions can result in minor or severe injuries, as well as danger to life. In addition, the performance of the vehicle may be impaired. Please also carefully read the warnings and notes next to the symbols, especially those concerning high voltage. Only in this way can proper installation of the conversion kit and accessories, as well as proper use of the vehicle, be ensured. Ignoring these warnings and notes means accepting potential damage to people and the vehicle.  

All technical data and descriptions contained herein were current at the time of printing. However, since continuous improvement is one of our main goals, we reserve the right to make changes to the products at any time. If you notice errors or omissions in this document, please post them in the Discord channel (see chapter “Useful Links”).

# BT Module  

The BT module is only required if you have a seat bench without a USB-C port next to the seat bench connector.  
If your seat bench has a USB-C port next to the logo, you can skip this chapter.

## 3. Mounting the BT Module  

Take a photo of or note the 5-digit BT module ID on the side of your BT module. You will need this later during the connection setup.  

### S50, S51, S70  

Open the left side cover and remove the upper hole cover of the central housing section. This cover is no longer needed and can be set aside. Then loosen the nut at the ground point in the heart box and remove it together with all ring cable lugs and washers. Next, open the right side cover. Hold the bolt of the ground point and loosen the nut on the left side. Remove this nut along with the washer and lock washer. Remove the bolt and replace it with the M6x50 screw (1). Now reinstall all previously removed parts and cables in reverse order and close the right side cover. Screw on a new M6 nut (2), followed by a washer (3), about 20 mm onto the end of the screw.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed6e013c-6bb6-4144-8f52-4295f0b91efe" width="500" />
</p>

Slide the BT module with its eyelet onto the screw, followed by the second washer and the nut. Ensure that the BT module’s button points in the driving direction. The module must not protrude beyond the heart box (4), so that the side cover can later fit back on properly.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4a3f473-6898-439f-8d9e-5d2a5d2d39db" width="500" />
</p>

Once the desired position is reached, hold the rear nut (2) with a 10mm wrench and tighten the front nut with a 10mm socket at 6 Nm. To mount the cable, continue with section 4.  

### KR51/2, KR51/1, KR51  

Loosen the wing nut on the engine tunnel and remove it. Slide the BT module from the front, starting before the cross brace (1), between the frame tubes (2) to the back until it reaches the corrugated tube (3). Make sure the button points in the driving direction and the logo faces upwards. For fastening, pull one cable tie through the upper (4) and then through the lower tab of the module, then place them around the adjacent frame tube (2). For a secure fit, all cable ties should be positioned behind the cross brace (1).  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32c05847-3fa7-453c-befa-6f1a0a01522b" width="500" />
</p>

Once the BT module is in position, tighten all cable ties evenly. To mount the cable, continue with section 4.  

### SR4-2, SR4-4  

Remove the side panels to gain access to the battery compartment. If the old battery is still installed there, remove it, as the BT module will be mounted in this place. Slide the BT module from the left side into the battery compartment until the eyelet (1) passes the stop (2). Make sure the button faces upward and the logo points backward. For fastening, first pull a cable tie through the tab (3), loop it around the stop (2), and tighten it securely.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/905fa588-8c2f-4d8c-9130-dfc1958f38d5" width="500" />
</p>

Then guide another cable tie through the tabs (4), pull it through the hole in the battery support surface (5), and tighten it as well.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48e161a4-19ac-472a-98e8-0ce0f4b95e62" width="500" />
</p>

To mount the cable, continue with section 4.  
### SR50, SR80  
Clamping the vehicle into a motorcycle lift and then raising it makes installing the BT module significantly easier. Loosen the wing nut and remove the engine and electrical covers. Under the air guide plate (1) there are two holes (2) in the frame plate.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e07b44b0-cdb4-4e82-acfb-e88cb74c6094" width="500" />
</p>

Place the BT module as shown with the underside on the frame plate, so that the threads on the underside of the module align with the holes (2) in the plate. A look from below helps to check alignment.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f15e56cf-13cc-40fa-983b-9c34ccc7c79c" width="500" />
</p>

Now place a spring washer on each M4x10 socket head screw. Insert each screw through one of the holes, screw it into the BT module, and tighten to 3 Nm (hand-tight, not too tight). To install the cable, continue with section 4.  

### Duo 4, Duo 4-1, Duo 4-2  
To fasten the BT module behind the mounting plate for the battery (1), press the top of the module against the mounting plate and rest it on the cross brace of the former lead battery holder (2), with the button facing upward. Pass a cable tie through the upper tabs (3), loop them around the cross brace (2), and tighten them securely. Another cable tie is passed through the upper tab (4) and around the mounting plate (1). The last cable tie is passed through the upper and lower tab (5) and fastened to the left tube (6), which connects into the handlebar tube.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6201e6f-8626-4883-a724-073784692ac3" width="500" />
</p>

Finally, tighten all cable ties evenly to securely fix the module. To install the cable, continue with section 4.  

## 4. Connecting the BT Module  

The male connector of the BT module (long cable) is connected to the diagnostic cable of the drive module. This creates a new diagnostic point, which is now the short cable end on the BT module.  

### Long Diagnostic Cable  

On drive modules with serial number #00193 and higher, there should be a cable about 40 cm long coming out of the bottom of the drive module. The plug has a rubber cap on it. If this is the case, continue with step 2.b.  

### Short Diagnostic Cable  

On drive modules with serial numbers #00038 to #00192, you will find the update cable as follows:  

### Removing the Cable Cover  

Remove the cable cover from the drive module by unscrewing the M4 cylinder head screw (1) on the right side. You will need a 3 mm Allen key for this. If your cable cover has an oval cutout on the top left in the driving direction, then underneath it hides a second M4 cylinder head screw, which only needs to be loosened one turn to remove the cover.  

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/857a182d-25e5-4776-9fe4-8d9f7b28565d" width="500" />
</p>

### Identifying the Diagnostic Cable  

Now you have found the Vehicle Control Unit (2) (we affectionately named it “Günter”). From Günter, a short cable (3) goes out, which is not connected further and is covered with a rubber cap.  

## 5. Cable Installation  

Remove the rubber cap and connect the long cable of the BT module. **Important: Make sure the arrows on the male and female connector align before pushing them together firmly.** Now use the supplied cable ties to fasten the cable between the BT module and the drive module to the vehicle frame. Avoid sharp bends in the cable. If the cable is too long, loop it and secure it with a cable tie.  

Now your BT module should be securely installed and connected to your vehicle.
