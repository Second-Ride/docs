      <input type="checkbox"> Have you tightened all screws properly? The drive module should have no play in its mounting.

      <input type="checkbox"> Is the chain slack approx. 2 cm?

  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 8px;">
      <input type="checkbox"> Are all cables neatly secured to frame parts with cable ties? Do they possibly obstruct steering movement or could they be caught by moving parts such as tires, shock absorbers, etc.?
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 8px;">
      <input type="checkbox"> Ensure functionality of indicators/lights, brakes, shock absorbers, anti-theft system, steering lock, cable routing, tire tread, etc.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding: 8px;">
      <input type="checkbox"> Are the front and rear wheels aligned (tracking)?
    </td>
  </tr>

## Step 2. Appointment with a technical inspector (TÜV, KÜS, GTÜ, etc.) authorized to carry out approvals according to §19 (2) or §21 StVZO

- Under [this link](https://second-ride.de/zulassung) you will find a map with all technical services where other customers have already registered their Second Ride conversion kit. If you click on the pins, you can also see more information about their experiences.  
- Required: SR24 parts certificate, provided with the kit  
- Checked:  
  - correct installation according to the assembly manual  
  - the general operating condition of the entire vehicle  

- An inspection report according to §21 StVZO – Technical modification (19.2) will be issued  
- Costs: billed according to inspector effort: previous experience ranges €90 – €290  

!!! note "Note":
    For many inspectors, the electric conversion of mopeds is something completely new and requires extra familiarization, which not all are willing to do. To avoid wasting time or money, we recommend this approach: First check our map to see if you can find an experienced inspector near you. If not, contact an inspector near you by phone and explain your plan. You will quickly find out how the inspector reacts. If you have a bad feeling, better go to the next one! Please help the next person by completing the survey under the same link afterward. If you have questions about registration, we and the Second Ride Community on Discord are happy to help!  

## Step 3. Update of the vehicle registration at the responsible registration authority

- Required: the above inspection report, SR24 parts certificate, valid vehicle documents  
- The valid papers will be marked “invalid”  
- Issuance of new documents with the drive type “Electric”  
- Costs: depending on administrative fee, in Berlin: €20  

## Step 4. Update of the insurance

- In general, the vehicle remains insured with an insurance license plate  
- Call the insurance company, which will update the drive type to electric in the system  
- Costs: e.g. at HUK Coburg €0
