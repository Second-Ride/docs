    ![alt text](img/IMG_2795.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2796.webp)

17. Lift the front rail up into the bottom extrusion of the right leg subassembly, and slide it towards you into the front right leg as shown. Tighten the front screw in place.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2797.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2798.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2799.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2800.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2801.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2802.webp)

18. Lift up the machine onto its back legs, and tighten in the final loose screw on the front right leg.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2803.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2804.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2805.webp)

19. Get the back rail. It has two right angle brackets on each side, and slots numbered 26-50. Get `4x` M5x8mm button heads and `4x` T-slot nuts and mount them into the open holes in the right angle brackets as shown below. Do this for all four brackets.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2808.webp)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_2809.webp)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_2806.webp)

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2813.webp)
    ![alt text](img/IMG_2814.webp)

20. Align the t-slot nuts perpendicular to the rail as shown.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2818.webp)

21. Place the back rail across the back legs as shown. Rotate it upwards into the bottom extrusion of the left leg subassembly, ensuring that both t-slot nuts fit into the v-slot. It should be flush against the rail.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2819.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2820.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2821.webp)


22. Make sure that the right side of the back rail has fit into the right leg extrusion. You might find that the back legs need to be pulled together or apart a little in order to get them to fit; **this is ok**. The back rail should be flush with the extrusion if the t-slot nuts have been inserted into the extrusion correctly.

    ![alt text](img/back-rail-offset.webp)

23. Slide the back rail up and let the left side of it rest on the spacing bracket included in your tool kit. Make sure it's resting on the short side (50mm). Lightly tighten the top screw on the left side, making sure to keep the end of the extrusion and right angle brackets perfectly flush with the side of the extrusion.

25. Bring the machine back down onto four legs.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2837.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2838.webp)

    !!! danger "Check for Squareness"
        Now is the best time to adjust your frame to ensure it's been assembled square.

        Take the build plate from your packaging and drop it onto the rails.

        ![](img/IMG_2871.webp)

        Pull the staging plate completely forward in the machine, and make sure the edge is flush with the extrusion on both sides of the machine. Then slide to the back of the machine and do the same. Loosen any frame bolts you just mounted to adjust until both sides of the staging plate are flush with the extrusion both at the front and back of the machine.

        ![](img/IMG_2916.webp)

26. Slide both Y gantries to the back of the machine (opposite the tension arms).

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2839.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2840.webp)

27. Grab the X gantry from the packaging and fit it onto the Y gantries as shown. Make sure the toolhead motors are facing you like the image below.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2842.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2843.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2844.webp)

28. Attach the X gantry to the Y gantries by installing a M5x25 socket head screw and M5x16mm socket head screw into the two holes on each side of the X gantry assembly.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2846.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2847.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2848.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2849.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2850.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2851.webp)

29. Tip the machine back up onto its back legs, and install front leg extensions onto the front legs with `2x` M5x16mm socket head screws for each leg.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2853.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2854.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2856.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2857.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2858.webp)

30. Install a back leg extension onto each of the back legs with an M5x16mm socket head screw for each leg.

    ![alt text](img/IMG_2859.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2860.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2861.webp) ![alt text](img/IMG_2862.webp)
